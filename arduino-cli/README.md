# Arduino CLI

Arduino CLI is an all-in-one solution that provides builder, boards/library manager,
uploader, discovery and many other tools needed to use any Arduino compatible
board and platforms.

> **Note:** this software is currently under active development: anything can change
  at any time, API and UI must be considered unstable until we release version 1.0.0.
